I built this PC in the fall of 2020 to replace my previous 5-year-old machine. I selected all the parts to work together in a performant and quiet manner. Building the computer took around an hour, but I made many small changes over the next few days involving airflow to see what configuration of fans could keep my components the coolest. I also tuned CPU and GPU voltages and clocks to make them output less heat for no perceptible loss of performance.

## Components
 - AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
 - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (Using my old GTX 970 at the moment due to shortages)
 - 32 GB 3600MHz G.SKILL RAM (2x16)

 - 1x 500 GB Samsung SSD
