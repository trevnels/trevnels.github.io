I modified and tuned a Creality Ender 3 to print much better than it did out of the box. Many of these modifications were 3D printed, including cable and filament management guides, ducting for cooling fans, and shields for sensitive parts of the printer. After many iterations of slicer settings along with these modifications, I managed to get my printer printing objects of the same quality as a 3D printer of over 4 times its cost.
