My résumé above is automatically rendered from its [Typst](https://typst.app) source whenever I make changes to it. My email and phone number have been redacted to avoid automated scraping/spam, so if you want to get a hold of me, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-nelson-a730411a0/) instead.
